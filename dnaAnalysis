'''
In order to practice file input/output operations using Python, including comparing and manipulating data, a DNA Analysis program was assigned. The brief is as follows.

"The scenario:

A spy deleted important files from a computer. There were a few witnesses at the scene of the crime, but no one is sure who exactly the spy was. Three possible suspects were apprehended based on surveillance video. Each suspect had a sample of DNA taken from them. The computer's keyboard was also swabbed for DNA evidence and, luckily, one small DNA sample was successfully retrieved from the computer's keyboard.

Given the three suspects' DNA and the sample DNA retreived from the keyboard, it's up to you to figure out who the spy is!

The project should have methods for each of the following:

Given a file, read in the DNA for each suspect and save it as a string
Take a DNA string and split it into a list of codons
Iterate through a suspect's codon list to see how many of their codons match the sample codons
Pick the right suspect to continue the investigation on (someone with 3 or more matches to the sample)"

The code:
'''

sample = ['GTA','GGG','CAC']

def read_dna(dna_file):
  dna_data = ""
  with open(dna_file, "r") as f:
    for line in f:
      dna_data += line
  return dna_data
      
def dna_codons(dna):
  codons = []
  for i in range(0,len(dna),3):
    if i > len(dna):
      break
    else:
      codons.append(dna[i:i+3])
  return codons
    
def match_dna(dna):
  matches = 0
  for codon in dna:
    if codon == sample[0] or codon == sample[1] or codon == sample[2]:
      matches += 1
  return matches

def is_criminal(dna_sample):
  dna_data = read_dna(dna_sample)
  codons = dna_codons(dna_data)
  num_matches = match_dna(codons)
  if num_matches >= 3:
    print "Suspect has %d matches with DNA sample. Continue investigation into suspect." % num_matches
  else:
    print "Insufficient matches. Suspect can be freed."
    
is_criminal("suspect1.txt")
is_criminal("suspect2.txt")
is_criminal('suspect3.txt')

(These text files were provided along with the sample included at the beginning).
