'''
To practice some basic principles such as dictionaries, a freeform project was assigned to create a rock, paper scissors game. 
The brief is as follows:

"The program should do the following:

Prompt the user to select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Instruct the computer to randomly select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Compare the user's choice and the computer's choice.
Determine a winner (the user or the computer).
Inform the user who the winner is."

The code is presented below.

print "Let's play rock, paper, scissors!"

"""The user will be prompted to select rock, paper or scissors, the program will then randomly make a choice and determine who is the winner"""

from random import randint

rps = ["ROCK", "PAPER", "SCISSORS"]
rps2 = ["PAPER", "SCISSORS", "ROCK"]
message = {"tie": "Tie game!",
          "won": "You won!",
           "lost": "You lost!"}

def decide_winner(user, comp):
  print "%s takes on %s!" % (user, comp)
  if user == comp:
    print message["tie"]
  elif rps.index(user) == rps2.index(comp):
    print message["lost"]
  else:
    print message["won"]

def play_RPS():
  user = raw_input("Enter rock, paper or scissors: ").upper()
  comp = rps[randint(0, 2)]
  decide_winner(user, comp)

play_RPS()
