Another project during my online Python course involved practising module imports, for loops and if conditionals by creating a Battleship game. As described by the course: "In this version of the game, there will be a single ship hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid. The player will have 4 guesses to try to sink the ship." The code is presented below.
'''

from random import randint
from time import sleep

board = []

print "BATTLESHIP"
sleep(2)
print ""
print "My battleship is hidden in one of the grid locations below. You have 4 turns to try and find it. Good luck!"
print ""

for x in range(5):
  board.append(["O"] * 5)
  
def print_board(board):
  for row in board:
    print "  ".join(row)

print_board(board)

def random_row(board):
  return randint(0, len(board) - 1)

def random_col(board):
  return randint(0, len(board[0]) - 1)

ship_row = random_row(board)
ship_col = random_col(board)
sleep(2)
print ""

for turn in range(4):
  
    print "Turn ", turn + 1
    guess_row = int(raw_input("Guess Row: ")) -1
    guess_col = int(raw_input("Guess Col: ")) -1
    
    sleep(1)
    print ""
  
    if guess_row == ship_row and guess_col == ship_col:
      print "Congratulations! You sunk my battleship!"
      board[guess_row][guess_col] = ""
      print_board(board)
      break
      
    else:
      
      if guess_row not in range(5) or guess_col not in range(5):
        print "Oops, that's not even in the ocean."
      elif(board[guess_row][guess_col] == "X"):
          print "You guessed that one already."
      else:
        print "You missed my battleship!"
        board[guess_row][guess_col] = "X"
    
      if turn == 3:
        print "My battleship was in row %d col %d" % (ship_row + 1, ship_col + 1)
        print "Game Over"        
        board[ship_row][ship_col] = "@"
      
      sleep(1)  
      print ""
      print_board(board)    
      print ""
