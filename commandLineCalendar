'''
A Command Line Calendar was assigned as a freeform project during my online Python course. Whilst a relatively basic calendar, this project allowed for the practice of various coding skills as well as requiring some thought to complete. The brief for the project is as follows:

"The user should be able to choose to:

View the calendar
Add an event to the calendar
Update an existing event
Delete an existing event

The program should behave in the following way:

Print a welcome message to the user
Prompt the user to view, add, update, or delete an event on the calendar
Depending on the user's input: view, add, update, or delete an event on the calendar
The program should never terminate unless the user decides to exit"

The code is presented below.
